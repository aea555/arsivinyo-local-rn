# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **NEVER run Android builds yourself** — do not invoke `expo run:android`, `npm run android`, `gradlew assemble*`/`install*`, or any background Gradle build. The maintainer runs all builds locally on the device. Make the code changes, run non-build checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run test:python`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run verify:prebuild`), then hand the build command to the maintainer. Only build if the maintainer explicitly says to. (`expo prebuild` is fine — it does not start a Gradle daemon.)
>
> **adb can wedge (the real cause of the "stalling").** The adb server occasionally hangs — especially right after a build — and that hang (not Gradle/Expo) is what stalls `expo run:android`/Metro. When adb is unresponsive or a command hangs, revive it before doing anything else with the device:
> ```bash
> adb kill-server        # if that itself hangs: pkill -f adb
> adb start-server
> adb devices            # confirm the device is back
> ```
> `adb` is on `PATH` via `ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk`. Avoid leaving long-running `adb logcat` captures running; stop them when done, since they contribute to the wedging.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npx expo prebuild --platform android      # regenerate native android/ from app.config.js + plugins
npm run android                            # build + run on Android (expo run:android)
npm run start                              # Metro bundler (rarely useful alone; this app needs custom native)
npm run lint                               # expo lint (eslint-config-expo flat)

# Local-downloader native pipeline verification
npm run verify:prebuild                    # MUST run after any change to app.plugin.js or ABI/manifest wiring
npm run verify:impersonation-wheels        # validates curl_cffi wheels + SHA256SUMS + VERSIONS.json
npm run build:impersonation-wheels         # requires CHAQUOPY_PYPI_DIR env var
npm run test:python                        # python3 -m unittest modules/local-downloader/tests/test_local_downloader.py

# Audio-preset DSP core (pure C++, no device needed — see "Audio presets" below)
npm run test:dsp                           # build + run the host-side DSP tests
npm run test:dsp:sanitize                  # same, plus an ASan/UBSan build

# Run a single Python test
python3 -m unittest modules.local-downloader.tests.test_local_downloader.<ClassName>.<test_method>
```

Host toolchain is Linux. `npm run verify:signing` is still a PowerShell script (`scripts/verify-signing.ps1`) and does not run here — port or replace it before relying on it.

Expo Go cannot run this project — the local-downloader native module is required. Always use `expo run:android` (or a custom dev client build).

Optional emulator support: `LOCAL_DOWNLOADER_ABIS=arm64-v8a,x86_64 npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android --no-install` — only valid when matching `x86_64` wheels and FFmpeg `.so`s are present.

## Architecture

This is an Android-first Expo app whose downloader pipeline runs **entirely on-device**. There is no backend. The flow is layered:

```
app/ (Expo Router screens)
  └─> src/api/*           TS wrappers, typed responses, error mapping
       └─> modules/local-downloader/src/   Expo native module bridge (TS)
            └─> ...android/.../LocalDownloaderModule.kt   Kotlin orchestration
                 ├─> DownloadForegroundService.kt          background service + sticky notification
                 ├─> DownloadActionReceiver.kt             notification action intents
                 ├─> QuickDownloadCaptureActivity.kt       share-sheet / clipboard entry
                 ├─> PrivateVaultImportActivity.kt         gated private-vault import (SAF)
                 ├─> SoundsImportActivity.kt               multi-select audio import (SAF)
                 ├─> sounds/SoundsStore.kt                 music library (MediaStore owner model)
                 └─> Chaquopy → python/local_downloader.py yt-dlp strategies + normalization
                      └─> FFmpeg/FFprobe (jniLibs .so, optional assets/ffmpeg fallback)
```

Cross-cutting things to know before editing:

- **`modules/local-downloader/app.plugin.js` is the source of truth for native wiring.** It injects Chaquopy gradle config, pip targets (`yt-dlp`, `curl-cffi==0.14.0`), ABI filters, the foreground service, the action receiver, and the three activities (quick-capture + the two SAF importers) into the generated `android/` project via tagged `// @generated begin/end ...` blocks. Never hand-edit files under `android/` — they are produced by prebuild and the plugin. After changing the plugin, run `npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android --no-install && npm run verify:prebuild`. Two gotchas: (1) `ensureApplicationEntry` **replaces** an entry's attribute set (not merge) so a removed attribute actually disappears on the next prebuild; (2) the SAF importer activities must **not** carry `android:noHistory` — a noHistory activity is finished the instant the full-screen document picker covers it, which cancels the pick before the user selects anything.

- **ABI coverage is an invariant that spans four locations.** Default ABI is `arm64-v8a`. If you add `x86_64` (or any other), you must update all of: `app.plugin.js` (`DEFAULT_REACT_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURES`), `modules/local-downloader/android/chaquopy-wheels/VERSIONS.json`, the verifier scripts under `scripts/`, and provide matching wheels + FFmpeg `.so` pairs. The verifiers will catch drift.

- **Two FFmpeg runtimes exist by design.** Primary path is `jniLibs/<abi>/libffmpeg.so` + `libffprobe.so` loaded as native libraries. Fallback is `assets/ffmpeg/<abi>/{ffmpeg,ffprobe}` extracted to private storage. The diagnostics screen (`app/diagnostics.tsx`) reports which one is active.

- **Public API surface for the downloader is `src/api/index.ts`.** Screens should not import from `modules/local-downloader/*` directly; go through `src/api/localDownloader.ts` and `src/api/download.ts`. Types live in `src/api/types.ts` and `modules/local-downloader/src/LocalDownloader.types.ts` — keep these aligned with the Kotlin module's exposed functions.

- **Routing is Expo Router with typed routes enabled** (`experiments.typedRoutes: true` in `app.config.js`). Tabs live in `app/(tabs)/`, modal/card screens at `app/*.tsx`. Root layout in `app/_layout.tsx` wires `I18nextProvider` → `ThemeProvider` → `Stack`.

- **Styling is NativeWind (Tailwind for RN).** `global.css` is the entry, configured via `metro.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`. The path alias `@/*` maps to repo root (see `tsconfig.json`), so imports look like `@/src/components`, `@/global.css`.

- **i18n** is `i18next` + `react-i18next`, initialized in `src/i18n` and provided at root. Translation keys are used throughout screen titles and UI.

- **Private vault flow** is auth-gated inside Kotlin (`LocalDownloaderModule.authenticateLocalPrivateAccess`) before TS can list, decrypt, or stream content via `expo-video`. The vault path is app-private storage.

- **Music library (in-app audio player)** is a separate subsystem from the vault. Audio downloads (`mediaKind: 'audio'`) go through yt-dlp's `bestaudio` + `FFmpegExtractAudio` path (Python) and are saved by `sounds/SoundsStore.kt` into the **public `Music/Arsivinyo`** folder via the MediaStore **owner model** — readable/writable with **no `READ_MEDIA_*` / `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission** (those stay blocked), but this requires **API 29+** (`SoundsStore.isSupported()` gates it). **Output format is M4A/AAC, not MP3:** the bundled FFmpeg (ffmpeg-kit 6.0) has no MP3 encoder (`libmp3lame`), so `_apply_audio_postprocessing` targets `preferredcodec="m4a"` (lossless remux when the source is already AAC; 256k AAC otherwise). **Cover art is NOT embedded** — that same FFmpeg also has no image encoder, so `EmbedThumbnail` (which transcodes the YouTube `.webp` cover) fails with `Error selecting an encoder`. Instead `writethumbnail` downloads the cover file, Python returns its path (`_resolve_thumbnail_file` → `thumbnail_path`), and `SoundsStore.storeThumbFromFile` copies it verbatim into the sidecar thumbnail store (`expo-image` renders WebP/JPEG/PNG from a path directly). Track title/artist tags are written into the file via `FFmpegMetadata` (stream copy, no encoder). Imports still pull art from the file's embedded cover via `MediaMetadataRetriever`. Tracks are plaintext (no vault/encryption). `sounds/index.json` caches metadata and owns playlists; it is reconciled against MediaStore on every list. **Favorites** is a reserved system playlist (id `favorites`, `system: true`) — `ensureFavoritesLocked` lazily creates it so it always exists, `deletePlaylist`/`renamePlaylist` reject it, and `setSoundsFavorite(ids, favorite)` adds/removes membership; the UI pins it to the top and exposes a smart heart toggle (Songs tab + player). Playback uses **`react-native-track-player` 5.x (the New-Architecture/TurboModule nightly)** — the 4.1.2 stable starts audio but its commands/remote events don't reach the player under bridgeless mode, so it's effectively uncontrollable; the old `patches/react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch` is gone. The service is registered in the custom `index.js` entry before expo-router. RNTP's Android notification opens the app with a `notification.click` deep link; `app/+native-intent.ts` rewrites that to `/sound-player` so it doesn't 404. UI: `app/sounds.tsx` (library) + `app/sound-player.tsx` (the currently-playing row gets an accent outline; tapping a row just plays — the full player opens via the mini-player or notification). Public API via `src/api/sounds.ts` → re-exported from `src/api/index.ts`. Do not auth-gate music — it is intentionally non-private. Heads-up: a JS-only reload (Fast Refresh) leaves RNTP's notification controls inert until a fresh app launch (`registerPlaybackService` only runs at startup) — a dev-only quirk, fine in release.

## Versioning

`app.config.js` is the **single source of truth** for both the app's `version` (string) and `android.versionCode` (integer). `expo prebuild` propagates both into `android/app/build.gradle`. Do not hand-edit the generated `versionCode`/`versionName` in `build.gradle`.

- **Scheme.** SemVer: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Prereleases use a `-beta.N` suffix (e.g. `2.1.0-beta.1` → `2.1.0-beta.2` → `2.1.0`).
- **versionCode** is a monotonic integer; bump on every Play Store upload (not every dev build). The initial recalibrated value is `20100`. The scheme is documentation-only — just keep it monotonic.
- **CHANGELOG.md** at the repo root is updated together with every version bump (Keep-a-Changelog format).
- **Git tags** use the `v` prefix (`v2.1.0-beta.1`, `v2.1.0`). Stable releases also get a GitHub release with the changelog entry copy-pasted.
- **In-app surface.** The diagnostics screen displays `version`, `versionCode`, and `channel` (derived: `'beta'` if version contains `-beta.`, else `'stable'`). Read these via `BUILD_CONFIG` from `src/config.ts`.
- **package.json `version`** is kept in sync cosmetically (Expo does not consume it).

## Version-pin coupling

When bumping any of these, update all together (the verifier will not catch every drift):

- `modules/local-downloader/app.plugin.js` — Chaquopy version, Python version, `curl-cffi` pin
- `modules/local-downloader/android/src/main/python/local_downloader.py` — yt-dlp call sites
- `modules/local-downloader/android/chaquopy-wheels/VERSIONS.json` — pinned dependency versions + ABI matrix
- `modules/local-downloader/android/chaquopy-wheels/SHA256SUMS` — regenerate after wheel changes

## Notes from README worth keeping in mind

- `newArchEnabled: true` and `reactCompiler: true` are on (see `app.config.js`).
- A set of Android storage permissions are explicitly **blocked** in `app.config.js` (`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `READ_MEDIA_*`, etc.) — the app uses scoped/private storage and `expo-media-library`'s explicit-save flow instead. Don't re-enable these without understanding the privacy posture.
- iOS and web are not supported runtimes for the downloader pipeline. iOS scaffolding exists but the native module is Android-only.
